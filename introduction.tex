\abschnitt{Introduction}

This proposal proposes to add \coro to the C++ standard.\\
\newline
In computer science routines are defined as a sequence of operations. The
execution of routines form a parent-child relationship and the child terminates
always before the parent. Coroutines (the term was introduced by Melvin
Conway\cite{Conway1963}) are a generalization of routines (Donald Knuth\cite{Knuth1997}). The
principal difference between coroutines and routines is that a coroutine enables
explicit suspend and resume of their progress via additional operations by
preserving local state. Coroutines support the implementation of components such
as cooperative tasks, iterators, infinite lists and pipes.\\
\newline
\coro is a first class \continuation (can be passed as argument, returned
by procedure and stored in a data structure to be used later).\\
The context switch is cooperative, e.g. the programmer controls when a switch
will happen (the kernel is not involved in the switch between coroutines).\\
