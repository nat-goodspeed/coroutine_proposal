\abschnitt{Abstract}
This paper proposes a {\bfseries low-level} and {\bfseries minimal API} for a
stackful execution context, suitable to act as {\bfseries building-block} for
{\bfseries high-level} constructs such as stackful coroutines as well as
cooperative multitasking (aka fibers/user-land threads/green threads).\\
\newline
The most important features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first-class object that can be stored in variables or containers
    \item symmetric API, in which the target context is explicit - enables a
          richer set of control flows than asymmetric API, in which a
          subordinate context can only switch back to its invoker
    \item benefits of traditional stack management retained
    \item ordinary function calls and returns not affected
    \item working implementation in Boost.Context\cite{bcontext}
\end{itemize}
