\abschnitt{Abstract}
This paper proposes a \emph{low-level} API for a stackful execution context, suitable
to act as building-block for high-level constructs like stackful coroutines from
N3985\cite{N3985} (boost.coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) as well as to implement
effective cooperative multitasking (boost.fiber\cite{bfiber}).\\
Based on the proposed low-level API, the follow-up proposal N4398\cite{N4398}
introduces a unified syntax for stackless and stackful coroutines.\\
\newline
The most important features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first-class object that can be stored in variables or containers
    \item introduction of new keyword \resumable together with a lambda-like
          syntax
    \item symmetric transfer of execution control, i.e. suspend-by-call -
          enables a richer set of control flows than asymmetric transfer of
          comtrol (i.e. suspend-by-return as described in N4134)
    \item benefits of traditional stack management retained
    \item ordinary function calls and returns not affected
    \item working reference implementation in boost.context\cite{bcontext}
\end{itemize}
