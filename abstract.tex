\abschnitt{Abstract}
This paper proposes a {\bfseries low-level} and {\bfseries minimal API} for a
stackful execution context, suitable to act as {\bfseries building-block} for
{\bfseries high-level} constructs such as stackful coroutines as well as
cooperative multitasking (aka fibers/user-land threads/green threads).\\
\newline
The most important features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first-class object that can be stored in variables or containers
    \item symmetric transfer of execution control, i.e. suspend-by-call -
          enables a richer set of control flows than asymmetric transfer of
          control (i.e. suspend-by-return as described in P0057\cite{P0057} et al.)
    \item benefits of traditional stack management retained
    \item ordinary function calls and returns not affected
    \item working implementation in Boost.Context\cite{bcontext}
\end{itemize}
