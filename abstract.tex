\abschnitt{Abstract}
This paper proposes a \emph{low-level} API for a stackful execution context,
suitable to act as {\bfseries building-block} for {\bfseries high-level}
constructs like stackful coroutines from N3985\cite{N3985}
(Boost.Coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) as well as to implement effective
cooperative multitasking (Boost.Fiber\cite{bfiber}).\\
Based on the proposed low-level API, the follow-up proposal N4398\cite{N4398}
introduces a unified syntax for stackless and stackful coroutines.\\
\newline
The most important features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first-class object that can be stored in variables or containers
    \item introduction of new keyword \resumable together with a lambda-like
          expression
    \item symmetric transfer of execution control, i.e. suspend-by-call -
          enables a richer set of control flows than asymmetric transfer of
          control (i.e. suspend-by-return as described in N4134)
    \item benefits of traditional stack management retained
    \item ordinary function calls and returns not affected
    \item working implementation in Boost.Context\cite{bcontext}
\end{itemize}
