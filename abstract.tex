\abschnitt{Abstract}
This paper proposes a \emph{unified syntax} for stackless and stackful
coroutines. The syntax is based on the evaluation of N4397\cite{N4397}.\\
\newline
The most important features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first-class object that can be stored in variables or containers
    \item introduction of new keyword \resumable together with a lambda-like
          expression
    \item symmetric transfer of execution control, e.g. suspend-by-call -
          enables a richer set of control flows than asymmetric transfer of
          control
    \item ordinary function calls and returns not affected
\end{itemize}
