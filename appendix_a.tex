\abschnitt{A. Existing practice}\label{appendixa}
As a library-only facility,
\cpp{boost::context::execution\_context<>}\cite{bcontext} is existing practice,
used to implement Boost.Coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2} and the
Boost.Fiber library\cite{bfiber}.\\
\newline
The facility described in this proposal adds significant semantics beyond
resumable functions. For instance, you cannot build cooperative user-mode
threads on resumable functions.\\
\newline
These libraries based on Boost.Context can seamlessly interoperate with
Boost.Asio\cite{basio}: Asio's \cpp{async\_result} mechanism (proposed for
standardization in N4588\cite{N4588}) supports adapters that can, using a
natural syntax, suspend the caller for the duration of an asynchronous network
call. For instance, using Boost.Coroutine2:
\cppf{coro}
It is important to realize that in these examples, the symbol \cpp{yield} is
neither a keyword nor a macro, but simply the name of an ordinary C++ object.

The same example recast using Boost.Fiber:
\cppf{fiber}
Libraries based on \ectx will similarly interoperate cleanly with the proposed
standard Networking Library\cite{N4588}.\\
\newline
At C++Now 2016\cite{boostcon} and CppCon 2016\cite{cppcon}, Nat Goodspeed
presented the Fiber library and described some use cases.
