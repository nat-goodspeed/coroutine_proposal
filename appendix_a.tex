\abschnitt{A. Existing practice}\label{appendixa}
As a library-only facility,
\cpp{boost::context::execution\_context<>}\cite{bcontext} is existing practice
and is used to implement Boost.Coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2} and the
Boost.Fiber library\cite{bfiber}.\\
\newline
This facility adds significant semantics beyond resumable functions. For
instance, you cannot build cooperative user-mode threads on resumable
functions.\\
\newline
These libraries based on Boost.Context can seamlessly interoperate with
Boost.Asio\cite{basio}: Asio's \cpp{async\_result} mechanism (proposed for
standardization in P0112\cite{P0112}) supports adapters that can, using a
natural syntax, suspend the caller for the duration of an asynchronous network
call. For instance, using Boost.Coroutine2:
\cppf{coro}
The same example recast using Boost.Fiber:
\cppf{fiber}
Libraries based on \ectx will similarly interoperate cleanly with the proposed
standard Networking Library\cite{P0112}.\\
\newline
At BoostCon 2016\cite{boostcon} and CppCon 2016\cite{cppcon}, Nat Goodspeed
presented the fiber library and described potential use cases.
