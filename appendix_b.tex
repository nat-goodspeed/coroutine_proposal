\abschnitt{B. \emph{std::execution\_context<>} as Thread of Execution (ToE)}\label{appendixb}
\ectx represents a ToE; each \ectx has its own execution path (e.g. follows
sequence of instructions). A OS-thread (\cpp{std::thread}) consists of at least
one \ectx (associated with the main-stack/thread-stack).\\
Multiple \ectx might interact in following manner:
\begin{itemize}
\item asymmetric coroutine == interaction of two \ectx
    \begin{itemize}
        \item strong coupled, callee \ectx can only resume caller
        \item direct exchange of data (in general bidirectional; generator
              restricts data flow in one direction)
    \end{itemize}
\item fiber == one \ectx
    \begin{itemize}
        \item loosly coupled (algorithm selects simply next ready fiber)
        \item no direct data transfer
    \end{itemize}
\item shift/reset operators == few interacting \ectx
    \begin{itemize}
        \item coupled
        \item data exchanged
        \item interwoven transfer of execution
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
