\abschnitt{Background}
At the meeting in Urbana the committee accepted that stackless and stackful
coroutines are distinct and decided to pursue both kinds of coroutines.\\
This paper proposes a low-level API for stackful context switching enabling
implementation of higher level constructs like stackful coroutines from N3985
(see boost.coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) as well as cooperative multitasking
(see boost.fiber\cite{bfiber}).\\
The author evaluates an alternative syntax providing stackful resumable lambdas.
