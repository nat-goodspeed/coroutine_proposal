\abschnitt{Background}
At the meeting in Urbana the committee accepted that stackless and stackful
coroutines are distinct and decided to pursue both kinds of coroutines.\\
This paper proposes a low-level API for context switching suitable to act as 
building-block for high-level constructs like stackful coroutines from
N3985\cite{N3985} (boost.coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) or cooperative
multitasking (boost.fiber\cite{bfiber}).\\
The author evaluates an alternative, 'resumable lambda'-like syntax for
stackful context switching.
