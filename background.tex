\abschnitt{Background}
At the meeting in Urbana the committee accepted that stackless and stackful
coroutines are distinct and decided to pursue both kinds of coroutines.\\
This paper proposes a low-level API for context switching enabling the
implementation of higher level constructs like stackful coroutines from N3985
(boost.coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) as well as cooperative multitasking
(boost.fiber\cite{bfiber}).\\
The author evaluates an alternative, 'resumable lambda'-like syntax for
stackful/stackless context switching.
