\abschnitt{Background}
At the meeting in Urbana the committee accepted that stackless and stackfull
coroutines are distinct and decided to pursue both kinds of coroutines.\\
This paper proposes a low-level API for stackfull context switching enabling
implementation of stackfull coroutines as proposed in N3985 (see
boost.coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) as well as cooperative multitasking (see
boost.fiber\cite{bfiber}).
