\abschnitt{Background}
At the meeting in Urbana the committee accepted that \sless and \sfull coroutine
are distinct and decided to pursue \sless and \sfull coroutines.\\
This paper proposes a low-level API for \sfcoros and tries to give an answer why
\sless and \sfull coroutines should have a different syntax.
