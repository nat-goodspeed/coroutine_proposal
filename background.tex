\abschnitt{Background}
At the November 2014 meeting in Urbana the committee discussed proposals for
\emph{stackless} (N4134\cite{N4134} and N4244\cite{N4244}) and \emph{stackful}
(N3985\cite{N3985}) coroutines. The members of the committee concluded that
stackless and stackful coroutines have distinct use cases and decided to pursue
both technologies.\\
\newline
The authors proposed N4397\cite{N4397} at the May 2015 meeting in Lenexa,
recognizing that the lower-level\\
\cpp{execution\_context} API is a more
powerful foundational abstraction than N3985 coroutines. For instance, with a
fiber library implemented on \cpp{execution\_context}, the \cpp{main()}
context (as well as each new thread) can access the same library functionality
as an explicitly-launched fiber.\\
\newline
This paper is an updated version of N4397.
