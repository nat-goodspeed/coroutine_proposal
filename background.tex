\abschnitt{Background}
At the November 2014 meeting in Urbana the committee discussed proposals for
\emph{stackless} (N4134\cite{N4134} and N4244\cite{N4244}) and \emph{stackful}
(N3985\cite{N3985}) coroutines. The members of the committee concluded that
stackless and stackful coroutines are distinct use cases and decided to pursue
both kinds of coroutines.\\
The committee encouraged the community to evaluate the possibility of a unified
syntax for coroutines.
