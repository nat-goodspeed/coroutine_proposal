\abschnitt{Background}
At the meeting in Urbana the committee accepted that stackless and stackful
coroutines are distinct and decided to pursue both kinds of coroutines. If
possible, a unified syntax would be preferred.\\
This paper proposes a syntax suiteable for stackless and stackful coroutines
based on the ideas of proposal N4397\cite{N4397} and completly different from
N4134\cite{N4134}.\\
