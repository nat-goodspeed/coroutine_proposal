\abschnitt{Characteristics}
The author agrees with the definitions made in N4134 (not repeated here) -
except the definition of a \fiber/\uthread.\\
Short: a coroutine is a language level construct providing an enhanced
control flow.\\
\newline
Coroutines have following characteristics\cite{N3985}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item values of local data persist between successive context switches
    \item execution is suspended as control leaves coroutine and resumed at
          certain time later
    \item symmetric or asymmetric control-transfer mechanism
    \item first-class object or compiler-internal structure
    \item stackful or stackless
\end{itemize}

\uabschnitt{\ascoro:}
provides two disting operations for contexts switch - one operation to
resume (\textit{await}) and one operation to suspend (\textit{yield}) the
coroutine.\\
A \ascoro is tightly coupled with its invoker, e.g. on suspendtion the
coroutine transferes the execution cotnrol back to its invoker.

\uabschnitt{\sycoro:}
only one operation (\textit{jump}) to resume/suspend the context is
available.\\
A \sycoro does not know its caller, e.g. the execution control can passed to
any other \sycoro.

\uabschnitt{\sfcoros of N3985:}
was intendet to be a library-only extension without requiring changes to the C++
language itself (no additional keyword).\\
Characteristics of N9885 \sfcoros:
\begin{itemize}
    \item stackfull
    \item symmetric: only one operation (\cpp{coroutine<>::operator()}) for
          context switch
    \item first-class objects (accessible in user-code; could be stored in
          container)
\end{itemize}
\sfcoros can be used in any use-cases but at performance cost.

\uabschnitt{\slcoros of N4134:}
is intented to provide an efficient language supported mechanism for \slcoros
introduceing two new keywords - \await and \yield.\\
Characteristics of N4134 \slcoros:
\begin{itemize}
    \item stackless
    \item asymmetric: two operations - \await and \yield - for context switch
    \item no first-class objects (coroutine structure/object is hidden by the
          compiler)
\end{itemize}
\slcoros might have higher performance than \sfcoros but cann't be used if
suspention from within nested call-stack is required.
