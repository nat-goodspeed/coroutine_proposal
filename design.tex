\abschnitt{Design}
in the first part the author describes class \ectx as the basic API, enabling to
implement high-level APIs for stackful coroutines (as proposed in
N3985\cite{N3985}, boost.coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2}) and user-mode threads
(executing tasks in a cooperative multitasking environment,
boost.fiber\cite{bfiber}).\\
Based on the feature set of \ectx the author evaluates n the second part a
syntax similiar to resumable lambdas known from proposal N4244 but with
different properties (stackful, symmetric etc.).

\uabschnitt{Class \ectx}
In contrast to resumable functions/lambda the author believes that providing
only one operation to resume/suspend an execution context is much more flexible
and efficient.\\
