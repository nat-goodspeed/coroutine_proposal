\abschnitt{Motivation}
This paper proposes \cpp{std::execution\_context}. \cpp{execution\_context} is
the crucial foundation on which a number of valuable higher-level facilities
can be built using pure C++.\\
\newline
\cpp{execution\_context} itself is, however, impossible to code in portable
C++. Having it provided with the runtime library will be enabling technology
for both third-party libraries and user applications.\\
\newline
As a library-only facility,
\cpp{boost::context::execution\_context}\cite{bcontext} is existing practice.\\
\cpp{execution\_context} is used to implement
Boost.Coroutine2\cite{bcoroutine2} and the candidate Boost.Fiber
library\cite{bfiber}.\\
\newline
This facility adds significant semantics beyond resumable functions. For
instance, you cannot build cooperative user-mode threads (such as those
supported by Boost.Fiber) on resumable functions.\\
\newline
These libraries based on Boost.Context can seamlessly interoperate with
Boost.Asio\cite{basio}: Asio's \cpp{async\_result} mechanism (proposed for
standardization in N4045\cite{N4045}) supports adapters that can, using a
natural syntax, suspend the caller for the duration of an asynchronous network
call. Libraries based on \cpp{std::execution\_context} will similarly
interoperate cleanly with the proposed standard Networking Library\cite{N4478}.\\
\newline
The authors intend to bring future papers to propose a cooperative fiber
library and ``stackful'' coroutines. \cpp{execution\_context} is foundational
for all such evolutionary work.
