\abschnitt{A. recursive descent parser using \ectx}\label{appendix}
This example (taken from Boost.Context\cite{bcontext}) uses a recursive descent
parser for processing a stream of characters.\\
The parser (a SAX parser or other event-dispatching framework would be
equivalent) uses callbacks to push parsed data to the user code. With \ectx the
user code inverts the control-flow. In this case, the user code \emph{pulls}
data from the parser.

You cannot use resumable functions for this example without transforming all
functions in the call chain into resumable functions - which is impossible for
closed source code, impractical at best for a large, complex code base.
